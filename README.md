## Purpose
*Capacity Counter* is a tool for setting and tracking capacity in any situation where a pre-determined finite number of units can be accomodated. 

### Problem Statement  
Limited capacity is a commonplace consideration within event settings, as well as many entertainment, food services and  retail settings. In each of these cases, an organisation may have the capacity to accomodate a fixed number of patrons, and tracking the number of patrons already accomodated may be of paramount importance to avoid overcrowding, inability to adequately provide services, and the breach of fire safety regulations.

The site was deployed to GitHub pages using the following procedure:
1. Select the repository within the developer's GitHub account (previously set to public)
2. Select "Settings".
3. Navigate to the "Pages" section within "Settings".
4. Under the heading "Source", select "Branch:main" (set to "None" by default).
5. Deploy page to GitHub pages (note: there may a delay of several minutes before a site can be viewed at the link then provided by GitHub).  

### Forking & Cloning Repositories  
Forking a repository allows one to make a copy with which to experiment without affecting or jeopardising the original. This does not require any special permissions from or direct contact with the original developer, provided the repository in question is public rather than private. You may wish to do this either to experiment with and learn from another party's code, or aid in improving an oper-source project by offering changes (note that forking is distinct from [branching](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)). To do this, one must have a GitHub account and be logged in. Then, simply visit the main page of the repository in question, and select the "Fork" option located in the upper-right corner (desktop) as shown in the image below. [Learn more about forks from GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).

Forking a repository does not create locally-stored copies of its files on your computer. To achieve this, you will also need to Clone the repository. For example, you may wish to do this if you wish to have a functioning copy of another party's code in under to compile and execute it locally. Cloning options are found under the "Code" drop-down button of a repository's main page, as shown in the image below.
