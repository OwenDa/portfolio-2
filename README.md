## Purpose
*Capacity Counter* is a tool for setting and tracking capacity in any situation where a pre-determined finite number of units can be accomodated. 

### Problem Statement  
Limited capacity is a commonplace consideration within event settings, as well as many entertainment, food services and  retail settings. In each of these cases, an organisation may have the capacity to accomodate a fixed number of patrons, and tracking the number of patrons already accomodated may be of paramount importance to avoid overcrowding, inability to adequately provide services, and the breach of fire safety regulations.
